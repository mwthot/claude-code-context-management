- Audit logging required for all data access

## Coding Standards

### General Principles

- Express.js or Fastify for REST APIs
- Jest for testing framework
- Prettier + ESLint for code formatting

#### Python
- Python 3.11+ required
- Type hints mandatory for functions
- Black for code formatting
- pytest for testing framework
- FastAPI preferred for new services

### Database Standards
- PostgreSQL 14+ for relational data
- Redis for caching and sessions
- MongoDB only for document-heavy use cases
- All schemas require migrations scripts
- Database per service pattern (no shared databases)

## Architectural Principles

### Microservices Patterns
- Services must be independently deployable
- API-first design with OpenAPI 3.0 specs
- Event-driven communication via message queues
- Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Health checks and readiness probes required

### API Design
- RESTful design principles
- Versioning via URL path (/api/v1/)
- Consistent error response format (RFC 7807)
- Rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Request/response validation against schemas

### Observability Requirements
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus format)
- Service dependencies must be documented
- SLOs defined for all critical paths

## Deployment Standards

### Container Requirements
- Docker images must be scanned for vulnerabilities

- Multi-stage builds for production images
- Non-root user required in containers
- Resource limits must be specified

### Kubernetes Standards
- Helm charts for application deployment
- Network policies required
- Pod security policies enforced
- Secrets managed via sealed-secrets
- Horizontal pod autoscaling configured

### CI/CD Requirements
- All code requires pull request review
- Automated tests must pass before merge
- Security scanning in CI pipeline
- Automated rollback on deployment failure
- Blue-green deployments for production

## Compliance and Audit

### Documentation Requirements
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major decisions
- API documentation auto-generated from code
- Runbooks for operational procedures
- Disaster recovery plans documented
- Data flow diagrams maintained

### Change Management
- All changes require JIRA ticket reference
- Breaking changes require 30-day notice
- Database changes require DBA review
- Security changes require security team review
- Performance impact assessment for major changes

### Audit Trail
- All API calls must be logged
- Database changes must be auditable
- User actions must be traceable
- Log retention: 90 days minimum
- Immutable audit logs required

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Git for version control
- Docker for containerization
- IDE with security plugins
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Local development must mirror production

### Access Control
- MFA required for all developer accounts
- SSH keys rotated every 90 days
- VPN required for production access
- Separate accounts for development/production
- Privileged access logged and monitored

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response
- Follow incident response runbook
- Security incidents: immediate escalation
- Data breaches: legal team notification
- Service outages: status page update
- Post-mortem required for all P1 incidents

### Contact Information
- Security Team: security@acme.corp
- Platform Team: platform@acme.corp
- On-Call: Use PagerDuty escalation
- Compliance: compliance@acme.corp
